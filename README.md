# NASA APOD API

Like the title states, this is an API for NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day.

You can use it sending a `GET` request to `/api/<year>/<month>/<day>`. \
It also can generate a PDF, which you can `GET` at `/api/pdf/<year>/<month>/<day>`.

You could also just use the Web Interface, which has __buttons__. (yes, very fancy; I know)

See it in action [here](https://apod9000.herokuapp.com/).
